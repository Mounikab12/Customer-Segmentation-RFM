# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

![](Customers_segmented.png)

### Why Customer Segmentation?
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for targeted marketing. 

RFM Analysis helps businesses identify high-value customers and optimize marketing strategies.

RFM Analysis helps businesses identify their best customers and create personalized marketing campaigns.

## Overview
This repository contains the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** notebook used for customer segmentation. The analysis aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, which helps businesses identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

This project uses real-world customer data to apply RFM segmentation.



## Project Structure
ðŸ“Œ **Data**: The folder where datasets used for analysis are stored (e.g., CSV files).

ðŸ“Œ [**Data Processing in Databricks**](RFM_Preprocessing.ipynb): several preprocessing steps were performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

âœ… Loaded & Explored Data (CSV files into Databricks)

âœ… Checked for Missing Values & Duplicates (Handled null values & removed duplicate transactions)

âœ… Transformed Data Types 

âœ… Performed Data Filtering 

âœ… Applied Joins & Aggregations (Merged datasets based on customer ID)

ðŸ“Œ [**RFM Analysis & Modeling in Jupyter Notebook**](RFM_Analysis.ipynb):

âœ… Loaded Preprocessed Data from Databricks into Jupyter Notebook

âœ… Performed RFM Computations
  
1. **Recency** (R): Days since last purchase
   
   How recently did the customer make a purchase?  

   This metric identifies the freshness of the customerâ€™s last purchase.
   
2. **Frequency** (F): Number of transactions
   
   How often does the customer make a purchase?

   This indicates how loyal the customer is to the brand.
   
3. **Monetary** (M): Total purchase amount
   
   How much money did the customer spend?

   This shows the value of the customer based on their spending.

âœ… Calculated RFM scores with Techniques:

* Simple Quartile Method (Divided RFM values into quartiles)
* Separate R, F, M Analysis - Tertiary Segmentation (Analyzed each RFM metric separately)
* Rank & Normalization Approach (Used z-score and Min-Max scaling for better comparability)

âœ… Applied Data Transformations:

* Log Transformation to handle skewness in Frequency & Monetary values
* Normalization to ensure better clustering results
  
âœ… Clustered Customers for Advanced Segmentation:

* K-Means Clustering for unsupervised segmentation and used Evaluation metrics
  
âœ… Generated Final Customer Segments & Insights:

* Identified Best (High-Value), At-Risk, and Dormant Customers

âœ… Prepared data for Power BI Dashboard visualization


## Key Insights
- Identified **high-value customers** for targeted marketing.
- Segmented customers into **different groups** based on their RFM scores.
- Performed **Analytics** to retain loyal customers and improve acquisition strategies for less engaged customers.
