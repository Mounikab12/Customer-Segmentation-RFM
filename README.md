# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

![](Customers_segmented.png)

### Why Customer Segmentation?
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for targeted marketing. 

RFM Analysis helps businesses identify high-value customers and optimize marketing strategies.

RFM Analysis helps businesses identify their best customers and create personalized marketing campaigns.

This project uses real-world customer data to apply RFM segmentation.

## Overview
This repository contains the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** notebook used for customer segmentation. The analysis aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, which helps businesses identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.


## Project Structure
ðŸ“Œ **Data**: The folder where datasets used for analysis are stored (e.g., CSV files).

ðŸ“Œ [**Data Processing in Databricks**](RFM_Preprocessing.ipynb): several preprocessing steps were performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

âœ… Loaded & Explored Data (CSV files into Databricks)

âœ… Checked for Missing Values & Duplicates (Handled null values & removed duplicate transactions)

âœ… Transformed Data Types 

âœ… Performed Data Filtering 

âœ… Applied Joins & Aggregations (Merged datasets based on customer ID)

ðŸ“Œ [**RFM Analysis & Modeling in Jupyter Notebook**](RFM_Analysis.ipynb):

âœ… Loaded Preprocessed Data from Databricks into Jupyter Notebook

âœ… Performed RFM Computations
  
1. **Recency** (R): Days since last purchase
   
   How recently did the customer make a purchase?  

   This metric identifies the freshness of the customerâ€™s last purchase.
   
2. **Frequency** (F): Number of transactions
   
   How often does the customer make a purchase?

   This indicates how loyal the customer is to the brand.
   
3. **Monetary** (M): Total purchase amount
   
   How much money did the customer spend?

   This shows the value of the customer based on their spending.

âœ… Implemented Multiple RFM Segmentation Techniques:

* Simple Quartile-Based Segmentation (Divided RFM values into quartiles)
* Separate R, F, M Analysis (Analyzed each RFM metric separately)
* Rank & Normalization Approach (Used z-score and Min-Max scaling for better comparability)

âœ… RFM Score Segmentation (Summed up RFM ranks to assign customer segments)

âœ… Different Quartile EDA for Top Customers (Explored quartiles differently to spot key customers)

âœ… Applied Data Transformations:

* Log Transformation to handle skewness in Frequency & Monetary values
* Normalization to ensure better clustering results
  
âœ… Clustered Customers for Advanced Segmentation:

* K-Means Clustering for unsupervised segmentation
* Elbow Method & Silhouette Score to determine optimal clusters
  
âœ… Generated Final Customer Segments & Insights:

* Identified Best (High-Value), At-Risk, and Dormant Customers

âœ… Prepared data for Power BI Dashboard visualization


## Key Insights
- Identify **high-value customers** for targeted marketing.
- Segment customers into **different groups** based on their RFM scores.
- Optimize **marketing campaigns** to retain loyal customers and improve acquisition strategies for less engaged customers.
