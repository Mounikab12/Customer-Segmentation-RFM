# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** notebook used for customer segmentation. The analysis aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, which helps businesses identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Project Structure
**Data**: The folder where datasets used for analysis are stored (e.g., CSV files).\n
**Preprocessing in Databricks**: several preprocessing steps were performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.\n
**RFM_Analysis**: The main notebook containing the RFM analysis process.

## Steps Involved in RFM Analysis
1. **Recency**: How recently did the customer make a purchase?  
   This metric identifies the freshness of the customerâ€™s last purchase.
   
2. **Frequency**: How often does the customer make a purchase?  
   This indicates how loyal the customer is to the brand.
   
3. **Monetary**: How much money did the customer spend?  
   This shows the value of the customer based on their spending.

## Key Insights
- Identify **high-value customers** for targeted marketing.
- Segment customers into **different groups** based on their RFM scores.
- Optimize **marketing campaigns** to retain loyal customers and improve acquisition strategies for less engaged customers.
